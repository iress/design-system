      This documentation is for the standalone <code>IressToast</code>{' '}
      component, and has been exposed for complex use cases where you are unable
      to use the <code>useToaster</code> hook. For most use cases, please use
      the hook and provider documented at{' '}

## Examples

### Status

The toast offers three status that set a distinctive colour and icon. They can be set using the `status` prop. Their different use cases are described here.

<ComponentExample story={ToastStories.Status} stories={ToastStories} />

### Heading

Use the `heading` prop to add a header to the toast. The header can be any component you like, but it is designed to support a simple heading element. If provided a string, it will display a `<h2 />` element with the string as its content.

**Note:** `headingText` and `headingLevel` props have been replaced with the `heading` render prop to give you more control over the `heading` element and its content. To use the previous behaviour, you can pass a string which will automatically create a `h2` element, or pass a `h*` element with the text as a child.

<ComponentExample story={ToastStories.Heading} stories={ToastStories} />

### Footer

The `footer` prop allows for content to be placed below the header and body of the alert. This can be useful for displaying call to actions.

<ComponentExample story={ToastStories.Footer} stories={ToastStories} />

### Dismiss Button

Dismiss Button is on the top right corner and it's showing/hiding based on `dismissible` prop.

**Note:** When it's `true`, `onClose` event is going to be available.

<ComponentExample story={ToastStories.Dismissible} stories={ToastStories} />
