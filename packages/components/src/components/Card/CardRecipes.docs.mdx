## Compose functions

Beneath the surface, the `IressCard` component uses a compose helper to manage its styling. These helpers are exposed as `composeIDSCard` and `composeIDSCardSlots` and can be used to create custom cards.

They accept a subset of `IressCardProps`. They also accept an optional second argument if you want to override the default styles with your own CSS module, or other `style` object (eg. CSS-in-JS).

### Use cases

1. You are using a third-party routing library with its own `Link` component and want to use it as a clickable card. This is similar to `IressButtonCard` and `IressLinkCard`.
2. You need a different base component to meet your requirements, such as `<article />` when displaying on a news page.
3. You need to add some additional styling to the internals of the card, such as a custom footer or a custom image.
