## Usage

`IressLink` is an alternative to the `IressButton` component, and is used when you want to add interactive text inside a block of static text.

If you provide a `href`, it will render as an `<a />` element. Otherwise it will render as a `<button />` element. This helps ensure it presents the correct role to assistive technologies for the best accessibility.

## When to use

- If you want to include a link alongside static text, use the `IressLink` component.
- If you want to have a call to action at the start or end of a block of contents, use the `IressButton` component instead.

## Examples

### Loading

Loading buttons give the user an indication something is happening (eg. a form submission or extra content being loaded) after they have been triggered.

The loading state can be activated by setting the `loading` prop to `true` and providing some `loadingText` for screenreaders to announce when in loading state (which defaults to Loading...).

When the loading state is activated, any click events on the link are disabled.

<ComponentExample story={ComponentStories.Loading} stories={ComponentStories} />

### Slot props

Use the slots to correctly position icons or badges inside buttons.

- **Prepend** - Places the element before the text
- **Append** - Places the element after the text

<ComponentExample story={ComponentStories.Slots} stories={ComponentStories} />

### Element

You can use the `element` prop to render a custom component as the link. This is useful for rendering a component from a third-party library, such as `react-router-dom`.

<ComponentExample story={ComponentStories.Element} stories={ComponentStories} />
