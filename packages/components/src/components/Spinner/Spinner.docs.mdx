# Spinner

<ComponentOverview
  description="Spinners notify the user that a task is being processed. They indicate that the app is busy, and should be used when the user has to wait for more than a few seconds."
  of={ComponentStories.Standalone}
  meta={ComponentStories}
/>

## Examples

### Standalone

When using the spinner on its own, you can define the `screenreaderText` prop to provide context to screen readers.

<ComponentExample of={ComponentStories.Standalone} />

### Message

You can display a message alongside the spinner. In this case, you do not need to define the `screenreaderText` prop, as you have a visible message to the user telling them what is happening.

<ComponentExample of={ComponentStories.Message} />
