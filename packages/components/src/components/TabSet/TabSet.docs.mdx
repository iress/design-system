# Tab Set

<ComponentOverview

  meta={ComponentStories}
/>

## Usage

The `IressTabSet` is a wrapper for `IressTab` components to make a up a set of tabs.

### Navigation

You can use the `IressTabSet` component to create tab navigation to control an area of the page, or even navigate between different pages.

<ComponentExample of={ComponentStories.TabNavigation} />

### With `children` prop

Using the `children` prop will automatically inject the content as a tab panel when active, along with appropriate attributes for accessibility, ensuring the tab and its associated panel can be navigated by screenreaders.

<ComponentExample of={ComponentStories.Panels} />

## Examples

### Default selected

If you would like to set a tab by default, use the `defaultSelected` prop.

<ComponentExample of={ComponentStories.DefaultSelected} />

### Controlled

You can use state to control the active tab by setting the `selected` property to which tab you would like to select. This should be the `value` of the tab you would like to select, or if you do not use the `value` prop, it's index.

<ComponentExample of={ComponentStories.Controlled} />

### Layout

`IressTabSet` controls the layout of the tab buttons. These will always appear at the top of the tab container, and can be aligned to the left (default), centrally or to the right via the `layout` prop.

<ComponentExample of={ComponentStories.Layout} />

### Lazy Loading

Tabs can be lazy loaded via state, allowing you to add/remove tabs as needed.

<ComponentExample of={ComponentStories.LazyLoading} />

### Badges and icons

You can add rich content into the `label` of the `IressTab` to customise the tab further.

Some common examples include:

- Adding a badge to the tab button.
- Adding icons to the tab button.

Notes:

- For best accessibility, the `IressTab` component will find the first focusable element inside the custom label to add the tab role.
