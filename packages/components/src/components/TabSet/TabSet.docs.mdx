# Tab Set

<ComponentOverview
  description="Tabs are used to display modular pieces of related data that do not need to be compared or accessed simultaneously."
  story={ComponentStories.Panels}
  stories={ComponentStories}
/>

## Usage

The `IressTabSet` is a wrapper for `IressTab` components to make a up a set of tabs.

**Note:** The `mapTabs` helper function, originally used to map tabs to its sub-components, is now deprecated. Instead, you can use `array.map` to map the tabs to `IressTab`.

### Navigation

You can use the `IressTabSet` component to create tab navigation to control an area of the page, or even navigate between different pages.

<ComponentExample
  story={ComponentStories.TabNavigation}
  stories={ComponentStories}
/>

### With `children` prop

Using the `children` prop will automatically inject the content as a tab panel when active, along with appropriate attributes for accessibility, ensuring the tab and its associated panel can be navigated by screenreaders.

<ComponentExample story={ComponentStories.Panels} stories={ComponentStories} />

## Examples

### Default selected

If you would like to set a tab by default, use the `defaultSelected` prop.

<ComponentExample
  story={ComponentStories.DefaultSelected}
  stories={ComponentStories}
/>

### Controlled

You can use state to control the active tab by setting the `selected` property to which tab you would like to select. This should be the `value` of the tab you would like to select, or if you do not use the `value` prop, it's index.

<ComponentExample
  story={ComponentStories.Controlled}
  stories={ComponentStories}
/>

### Layout

`IressTabSet` controls the layout of the tab buttons. These will always appear at the top of the tab container, and can be aligned to the left (default), centrally or to the right via the `layout` prop.

<ComponentExample story={ComponentStories.Layout} stories={ComponentStories} />

### Lazy Loading

As of version 5, tabs can be lazy loaded. However, to ensure they work correctly you will need to set the `value` prop on each `IressTab`, as shown in this example.

<ComponentExample
  story={ComponentStories.LazyLoading}
  stories={ComponentStories}
/>

### Badges and icons

You can add rich content into the `label` of the `IressTab` to customise the tab further.

Some common examples include:

- Adding a badge to the tab button.
- Adding icons to the tab button.

Notes:

- For best accessibility, the `IressTab` component will find the first focusable element inside the custom label to add the tab role.

<ComponentExample
  story={ComponentStories.TabsWithBadges}
  stories={ComponentStories}
/>
