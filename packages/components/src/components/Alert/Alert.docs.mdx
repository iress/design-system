# Alert

<ComponentOverview
  description="An alert displays a short, important message in a way that attracts the user's attention without interrupting the user's task."
  of={AlertStories.Default}
  meta={AlertStories}
/>

## Examples

### Status

The alert offers four statuses that set a distinctive colour and icon. They can be set using the `status` prop. Their different use cases are described here.

<ComponentExample of={AlertStories.Status} />

### Heading

An alert can be displayed with a heading. This is controlled by the `heading` prop. If provided a string, it will display a `<h2 />` element with the string as its content. If provided a React element, it will display that element directly.

**Note**: The `heading` prop replaces the `headingText` and `headingLevel` props from previous versions of IDS. These prop are now deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

### Actions

The `actions` prop allows you to display call to action buttons within the alert. This is useful for providing users with options to take action based on the alert message.

### Icon

The `icon` prop allows you to customise the icon displayed in the alert. It accepts a string for the icon name, or can be set to `false` to remove the icon entirely.

### Variants

The alert can be displayed in different variants to suit different use cases. The `variant` prop allows you to set the variant of the alert. The available variants are:

- `sidebar`: The alert is displayed in the sidebar of the page, typically used for informational messages on longer forms.
- `site-wide`: The alert is displayed in the site-wide banner, typically used for important messages that need to be seen by all users.

### Dimissable

The alert can be made dismissable by setting the `onDismiss` prop. This will display a close button in the top right corner of the alert, allowing users to dismiss it.
