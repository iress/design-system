# Provider

<ComponentOverview
  description="Provider is a component that sets up the Iress Design System for your application. It ensures that the design system is correctly configured and ready to use."
  story={ComponentStories.Provider}
  stories={ComponentStories}
/>

## Usage

The design system provider automates some set-up tasks for you, including:

- Adding the icon fonts and CSS variables to the document head
- Consistent container handling for providers, if you need the modals, slideouts and toasts rendered in a specific area (common with micro frontends)

In most cases, you should wrap the entire application with the `IressProvider` component. This will ensure that the design system is set up correctly and consistently across the application.

```tsx
import { IressProvider } from '@iress-oss/ids-components';

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <IressProvider>
    <IressTheme />
    <App />
  </IressProvider>,
);
```
