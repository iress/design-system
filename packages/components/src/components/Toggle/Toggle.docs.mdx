# Toggle

<ComponentOverview
  description="Toggles allow users to turn things on or off. When toggled, the associated change happens straight away."
  story={ComponentStories.Default}
  stories={ComponentStories}
/>

## Usage

Toggles are typically on / off switches, similar to a household light switch. They allow users to choose between two mutually exclusive options, and will always have a default value.

The `IressToggle` component should only be used for actions that happen immediately, for example switching a device's WiFi connection on or off.

<IressAlert
  status={IressAlert.Status.Warning}
  heading="Don't use Toggles in forms"
  className="iress-mb--md"
>
  Toggles shouldn’t be used as part of a form as they don’t have the correct
  semantics, and won’t submit a value when the form data is submitted. If you
  need a toggleable component in a form, use a checkbox or radio group instead.
</IressAlert>

### Labels

Toggles should always have a label, which is set via its `children`.

<ComponentExample story={ComponentStories.Default} />

### Hidden labels

Labels can be hidden via the `hiddenLabel` prop; this will hide the label from view, but it'll still be available to screen reader users.

<ComponentExample story={ComponentStories.HiddenLabel} />

### Checked

The on / off state of the toggle can be controlled by setting the `checked` prop.

<ComponentExample story={ComponentStories.Checked} />

### Layout

The `layout` prop allows you to control the position of the label in relation to the control. The default layout is `inline`, but you can also choose the following options:',

- `inline-between` similar to inline, but this positions the label and control at opposite ends of their container
- `inline-reverse` renders the label after the control instead of before the control
- `stack` positions the label above the control

<ComponentExample story={ComponentStories.Layout} />
