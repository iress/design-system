      The <code>IressText</code> component allows you to set typographic styles
      either on one element, or a block on HTML elements.
    </>
  }
  of={ComponentStories.Default}
  meta={ComponentStories}
/>

## Usage

### The `element` prop

With the `element` prop you can select which HTML element you would like the text component to render as.

It renders as a `div` by default, but can also be set to any standard typography element.

<ComponentExample of={ComponentStories.Element} />

### The `textStyle` prop

The `textStyle` prop (previously `variant`) allows you alter the default styling of the element that it selected.

For example, in order to maintain the semantic structure of headings, you may need to style a `h2` element like a `h4`. Or you may want to style your heading using one of our display text formats.

<ComponentExample of={ComponentStories.Variant} />

### The `color` prop

The `color` prop (previously `mode`) can be used to set the colour of the text to these predefined mode colours: Body, Muted, Primary, Info, Success, Warning, Danger, Positive and Negative.

<ComponentExample of={ComponentStories.Mode} />

### The `textAlign` prop

The `textAlign` prop (previously `align`) can be used to set the text's alignment.

<ComponentExample of={ComponentStories.Align} />

## Behaviour

### Headings with icons

Icons can be added to a heading by simply including the icon as a direct child of the heading, as below.

The icon inherits the font size from the heading, so there is no need to set a size on the icon. If the icon is the first or last child of the heading, it will have some inline spacing added to save you from having to use the `IressInline` component.

<ComponentExample of={ComponentStories.HeadingsWithIcons} />

### Block of typographic content

If you just need to style a block of typography content, you can just wrap the entire block of HTML with the text component.

<ComponentExample of={ComponentStories.TypographicBlock} />
