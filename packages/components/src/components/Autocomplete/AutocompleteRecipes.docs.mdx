  This API is experimental. It may change in the future based on usage. The team
  is testing if these use cases exist and see if its worth maintaining this API.
  If you have any questions, concerns or feedback, please reach out to the
  design system team.

## `useAutocompleteSearch`

`IressAutocomplete` uses the `useAutocompleteSearch` hook to provide search functionality. If provided an array of `LabelValueMeta`, it will search options based on the `label` property. To fully customise how to search the objects, pass a function instead.

It has been exposed in case you need it in your application to provide custom search functionality.

### Use cases

1. You want to provide filtering in a certain area of the application (eg. a table).

<ComponentExample of={AutocompleteRecipes.Table} meta={AutocompleteRecipes} />

<ComponentApi
  of={AutocompleteRecipes.Table}
  heading="Parameters"
  headingLevel={3}
/>
