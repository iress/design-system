## Accessibility

For Accessibility guidelines refer to
[W3 ARIA Patterns Disclosure](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/disclosure/), [W3 ARIA Patterns Accordion](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/accordion/).

## Examples

### Mode

Expander has a `mode` prop which can be used to change how the expander is displayed. There are two modes `section` (default) and `link`.

- `section` mode is used to expand larger sections of rich content, such as a table or a detailed transcript.
- `link` mode is used to expand a small section of content, usually used to provide additional context (eg. "Learn more" or "See more details").

<ComponentExample story={Stories.Mode} stories={Stories} />

### Open

The `open` prop can be used to control the open state of the expander as can be seen below.

<ComponentExample story={Stories.Open} stories={Stories} />

### Multiple expanders (accordion)

You can use multiple expanders to create an accordion, where al expander closes when another is opened.

<ComponentExample story={Stories.Multiple} stories={Stories} />
