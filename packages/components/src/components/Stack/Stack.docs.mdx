## Examples

### Gap

Vertical spacing is applied to the direct children of the `IressStack` component. The amount of spacing is controlled by the gap prop which accepts from `spacing.000` to `spacing.1200`.

#### What happened to `gutter`?

The previous `gutter` prop has been replaced by `gap`, which uses the latest set of spacing tokens. In terms of how it is used to space items inside the `IressStack` component, it is now directly mapped to the [CSS gap property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gap), which may change how your application is spaced. For most cases, there should be no change.

### Responsive gap

The `gap` prop can take an object that takes five key/value pairs that correlate with the IDS breakpoints.

### Inline children

The stack component will treat the direct children as a block element. If you want to wrap some items to display them inline, wrap them with `IressInline`.

In the example below: `IressButton` are inline because of wrapped by `IressInline`.

### Lists

`IressStack` can also apply gap between the list items by using the new `element` (e.g. `ul`) prop.
