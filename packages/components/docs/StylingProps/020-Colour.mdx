  These are all styling props related to changing the foreground and background
  colours of a component.
</IressText>

## `bg`

The `bg` prop allows you to change the background of any component to the value of a colour token. It should be used sparingly, and usually alongside the `color` prop to ensure accessibility.

Below is an example of a component using `bg` and `color` to create a featured panel that changes colour depending on the theme.

<CanvasWithApi of={ComponentStories.bg} />

## `color`

Below is an example of using the `color` prop to highlight text throughout a component.

<CanvasWithApi of={ComponentStories.color} />
