# Elevation

<IressText textStyle="typography.body.lg" mb="md">
  These are all styling props related to changing the elevation of a component
  to help guide visual hierarchy.
</IressText>

## `layerStyle`

The `layerStyle` prop allows you to draw attention to certain parts of the screen, making a screen easier to scan. The following styles are available:

- `elevation.raised`: Raised elevations sit slightly higher than other content. They are reserved for cards that can be moved, such as Jira issue cards and Trello cards. In special circumstances, they can be used for cards as a way to provide additional heirarchy or emphasis.
- `elevation.floating`: Floating is the highest elevation available. It is reserved for a UI that sits over another UI, such as modals, dialogs, dropdown menus, floating toolbars, and floating single-action buttons.
- `elevation.overflow`: Overflow is a shadow indicating content has scrolled outside a view. It can be used for vertical or horizontal scroll. An example of overflow shadows is the horizontal scroll in tables on a Confluence page.

## `focusable`

The `focusable` prop allows you to set the focus state of a component. This is useful for components that need to be interactive via keyboard, but are not necessarily a button or input.

It can be set to `true` to enable focus styles when the element is focused using keyboard navigation, or `within` to show focus styles when an element within is focused.
