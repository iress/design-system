# Spacing

<IressText textStyle="typography.body.lg" mb="md">
  These are all styling props related to changing the spacing of a component.
</IressText>

## Padding

There are seven props you can use to customise the padding of any component. It accepts the entire spacing token spectrum.

- `p`: Change the padding on all axes
- `px`: Change the padding on the left and right of a component
- `py`: Change the padding on the top and bottom of a component
- `pl`: Change the padding on the left of a component
- `pr`: Change the padding on the right of a component
- `pt`: Change the padding on the top of a component
- `pb`: Change the padding on the bottom of a component

### Responsive padding

All padding props are responsive and can be changed according to different screen sizes.

<CanvasWithApi of={ComponentStories.responsiveVariablePadding} />

### Migrating from version 5

Responsive padding worked differently in version 5. The `p` prop no longer accepts a nested object of axes to change the padding, you must change every prop based on the breakpoint.

## Margin

There are seven props you can use to customise the margin of any component. It accepts the entire spacing token spectrum, `auto` and negative values of the spacing token spectrum.

- `m`: Change the margin on all axes
- `mx`: Change the margin on the left and right of a component
- `my`: Change the margin on the top and bottom of a component
- `ml`: Change the margin on the left of a component
- `mr`: Change the margin on the right of a component
- `mt`: Change the margin on the top of a component
- `mb`: Change the margin on the bottom of a component

<CanvasWithApi of={ComponentStories.responsiveVariableMargin} />

### Negative margin

Negative margin is supported in the same way as positive margin. You can use the same props to set negative margin.

## `noGutter`

The `noGutter` prop removes the bottom margin of the last direct child of a component. This is useful when you have nested content inside a component with padding, such as `IressPanel` or `IressCard`, to remove unnecessary spacing in your layout.
