# Screen readers

<IressText textStyle="typography.body.lg" mb="md">
  These are all styling props related to adjusting components for screen
  readers.
</IressText>

## `srOnly`

The `srOnly` prop allows you to set a component to be only visible on screen readers. It is used to ensure the screen reader has context of the screen to help the user understand the tasks required of them.

<CanvasWithApi of={ComponentStories.srOnly} sourceState="shown" />

### Responsive

The `srOnly` prop is responsive, allowing you to show content on larger screens and hiding them on smaller ones, enabling screen readers to have the same context as larger screens as they are not limited by device size.

<CanvasWithApi of={ComponentStories.srOnlyResponsive} sourceState="shown" />
