# Core Design Principles

## Consistency

- Maintain brand consistency across all applications and experiences
- Use standardised component naming conventions (all components start with `Iress` prefix)
- Leverage shared design tokens for spacing, colours, typography, and interactive states
- Ensure consistent behaviour patterns across similar components

## Accessibility First

- Meet or exceed WCAG 2.1 Level AA Accessibility Guidelines
- Provide proper colour contrast ratios (minimum 4.5:1 for AA, 7:1 for AAA)
- Implement comprehensive keyboard navigation support
- Include screen reader compatibility with appropriate ARIA attributes
- Support focus management and skip navigation patterns
- Document accessibility considerations and requirements

## Clarity and Usability

- Prioritise clear visual hierarchy through typography scales and spacing systems
- Use progressive disclosure to manage complexity
- Provide immediate feedback for user actions (loading states, validation, etc.)
- Design for touch-friendly interfaces with adequate target sizes

## Developer Experience

- Maintain clean component APIs with predictable prop patterns
- Provide comprehensive documentation with usage examples
- Include common patterns and anti-patterns
- Support both controlled and uncontrolled component patterns
- Enable efficient testing strategies with semantic roles and accessible queries
- Maintain up-to-date prop documentation and type definitions

## Quality assurance

- Test components across supported browsers and devices
- Validate accessibility compliance with automated and manual testing
- Ensure proper keyboard navigation functionality
- Test with assistive technologies (screen readers, voice control)

### Code Standards

- Follow consistent naming conventions for CSS classes and component props
- Use semantic HTML elements where appropriate
- Implement proper TypeScript typing for better developer experience
- Maintain clean separation between presentation and logic

### Performance Considerations

- Optimise component rendering and re-rendering
- Implement appropriate code splitting strategies
- Use efficient animation and transition patterns
- Consider bundle size impact of component dependencies
