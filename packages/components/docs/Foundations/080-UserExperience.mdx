# User experience

We use heuristic guidelines to assess the usability and user-centred design quality of all Iress products.

## System Feedback

- Always show users where they are, what just happened, and what’s possible next.
- Provide immediate visual and textual feedback for all actions and states.
- Ensure feedback is clear, contextual, and proportionate to the importance of the action.

## Language and Mental Models

- Use user-centred language and avoid technical jargon.
- Follow cultural and industry conventions for colour, iconography, terminology, and layout.
- Align interaction patterns with real-world analogues wherever feasible.

## Control and Forgiveness

- Make actions reversible and provide undo where errors may occur.
- Let users easily backtrack, edit inputs, or abandon flows.
- Provide escape hatches from any process without penalty.

## Standards and Consistency

- Use consistent layout, labelling, iconography, and grammar.
- Reinforce expectations by placing similar elements in predictable positions.
- Apply colour, spacing, and visual patterns consistently across all screens.

## Error Prevention and Recovery

- Prevent errors by anticipating misuse and validating early.
- Phrase error messages with clarity, empathy, and constructive suggestions.
- Where errors occur, explain why and how they can be resolved.

## Recognition Over Recall

- Display necessary information at the point of decision.
- Use visual grouping, spacing, and affordance to reveal hierarchy.
- Prioritise visual clarity over novelty.

## Simplicity and Minimalism

- Remove unnecessary detail—every word, element, or feature should earn its place.
- Design for clarity of purpose with visually distinct, semantically meaningful UI components.
- Use whitespace, clean alignment, and simplified flows to reduce cognitive load.
