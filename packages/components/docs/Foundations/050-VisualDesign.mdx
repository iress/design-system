# Visual Design Standards

## Typography

- Use systematic font sizing with heading scales (H1-H6)
- Implement consistent line heights and font weights
- Provide text colour hierarchies (primary, muted, success, warning, danger)
- Support responsive typography scaling

## Colour System

- Maintain semantic colour meanings:
  - **Primary**: Main call-to-action colour with high contrast
  - **Success**: Positive outcomes and confirmations
  - **Warning**: Caution and important notices
  - **Danger**: Errors and destructive actions
  - **Info**: Neutral information and guidance
  - **Positive/Negative**: Financial context (buy/sell actions)
- Ensure all colour combinations meet accessibility contrast requirements
- Provide consistent hover and active state colours

## Spacing and Layout

- Use systematic spacing scale (xs, sm, md, lg, xl)
- Apply consistent gutter systems for layout components
- Implement responsive breakpoints for adaptive layouts
- Maintain proper margin and padding relationships

## Interactive States

- Provide clear hover, focus, active, and disabled states
- Use consistent transition timing and easing
- Implement proper focus indicators for keyboard navigation
- Show loading states for asynchronous operations
