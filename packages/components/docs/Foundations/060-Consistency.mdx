# Using components consistently

## Buttons

- **Primary**: Limit to one per view for main call-to-action
- **Secondary**: Use for secondary actions
- **Tertiary**: Extra affordance between secondary actions
- **Link**: Button styled as link (avoid with icon-only content)
- **Danger**: Destructive actions requiring extra confirmation
- **Positive/Negative**: Financial transactions (buy/sell)

## Forms

- Always use `IressField` wrapper for proper label, hint, and error placement
- Provide clear validation feedback with appropriate error messages
- Use consistent input sizing based on expected content length
- Implement proper form state management and accessibility

## Navigation

- Use semantic HTML5 navigation elements
- Provide skip links for keyboard users
- Implement proper ARIA labelling for navigation sections
- Ensure consistent navigation patterns across applications

## Data Display

- Use semantic table structures with proper headers
- Provide clear visual hierarchy in data presentations
- Implement consistent sorting and filtering patterns
- Use appropriate loading states for data-heavy components

## Modals and Overlays

- Reserve modals for critical tasks requiring full attention
- Provide multiple dismissal methods (backdrop, escape key, close button)
- Implement proper focus management and restoration
- Use slideouts for supplementary tasks where underlying content needs visibility
