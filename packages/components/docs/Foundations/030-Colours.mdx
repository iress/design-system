# Colours

Colour is an integral aspect of conveying clear concise data. Our colours are optimized across two backgrounds, meeting or exceeding [WCAG 2.1 Level AA Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum).

The Iress themes are designed to meet WCAG contrast guidelines (2.1 AA). We can't guarantee this when consumer branding is applied, so colour combinations should be checked to ensure conformance.
