# Typography

Typography is set up as part of the theming. Typography is controlled by the `IressText` component and the `iress-u-text` utility class. They implement consistent line heights and font weights.

Typography styles are designed to be encapsulated. If you want text to pick up the Iress styling, you'll need to wrap it in an `IressText` component.

## Body

This is the default text variant, and is designed to be clear and easy to read.

## Headings

Headings form the structure of a web page. They're designed to stand out visually, drawing a user's eye to distinct sections of the document. They can be set in a variety of sizes based on systematic font sizing with native heading scales (H1-H6).

## Display

Display text is used to draw attention to specific pieces of content, like introductory text on a landing page. It has larger font sizes than the heading variants, and a lighter font weight.

## Lead

Lead text is used to introduce users to a new section, and often gives a brief summary of a section. It has a larger font size than body text, but a lighter font weight so that it doesn't clash with headings.

## Caption

The caption variant is used for small text that provides additional information about a table or image. It has a smaller font size than body text, and a lighter font weight.

## Other variants

IDS also includes bold, italic and small text variants.

- Bold text should be used to **draw attention** to part of a sentence, or to provide a visual label for readonly text.
- Italic text should be used to add _emphasis_ to content, or to add stress to part of a sentence.
- Small text is used for side comments or for text that's secondary to the main content.
- Muted text is used to de-emphasise content, such as when displaying informative text that is not critical to the user experience.
