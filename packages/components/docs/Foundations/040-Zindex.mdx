# Z-index (stacking)

The z-index determines the stacking order of elements. Elements with a higher z-index always sit in front of elements with a lower z-index. Each index has been mapped to the appropriate elevation(s).

## For developers

If you are using the IDS components, the z-indexes have already been mapped out to their respective components based on the usage above. They are hardcoded into the components, so you don't need to worry about them.

The mapping is exported as `Z_INDEX` from the `@iress-oss/ids-components` package, in case you need to reference it in your own code.
