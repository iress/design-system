# Code Katas

A code kata is an exercise in programming that helps a programmer hone their skills through practice and repetition. Code katas are a great way to learn a new language, practice a new technique, or just to keep your skills fresh. They are also a great way to get a team to practice working together.

In our case, we will be using code katas to help you practice using the Iress Design System (IDS) components.

1. Lightsaber Order Form: This code kata was created specifically to introduce version five to Iress product engineering teams. It allows you to practice using the latest `IressForm` and its controlled elements, as well as practice writing tests efficiently using React Testing Library out-of-the-box.
2. Pizza Ordering: This is an older kata that is great for practicing UI in general.

The code katas can be found in the Code Katas repository.
