# Develop

Set up your environment to use the latest version of the Iress Design System (IDS). You can use this library to build React applications that align to IDS, and ensure a consistent and modern look and feel across all Iress products.

## Requirements

- [React 17 or later](https://reactjs.org/)
- Access to Iress Artifactory

## Set up the component library

1. Install using the command line:
   ```sh
   yarn add @iress-oss/ids-components
   ```
2. Import the styles:
   ```tsx
   import '@iress-oss/ids-components/dist/style.css';
   ```
3. Import the components. The provider is optional, but recommended for most applications. It sets up the design system and provides a consistent container for components like modals, slideouts, and toasts.
   ```tsx
   import { IressProvider, IressButton } from '@iress-oss/ids-components';
   ```
4. Use the components:

   ```tsx
   const App = () => (
     <IressButton onClick={() => success({ children: 'Toast triggered' })}>
       Trigger toast
     </IressButton>
   );

   ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
     <IressProvider>
       <App />
     </IressProvider>,
   );
   ```

## Set up the theme

The component library comes with the white label theme by default. You can add a theme by importing the theme file and including it in your application.

<IressAlert status="info" heading="Microfrontends" className="iress-mb--md">
  If you are building a React App that is intended to be used as a
  microfrontend, please skip this step. Microfrontends should inherit the parent
  application's theme, and not define a theme itself, as it may conflict with other
  microfrontends in the same parent application.

</IressAlert>

1. Install using the command line:
   ```sh
   yarn add @iress/ids-themes
   ```
2. Import the component:
   ```tsx
   import { IressTheme } from '@iress-oss/ids-components';
   ```
3. Add the component to your application:
   ```tsx
   ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
     <IressProvider>
       <IressTheme />
       <App />
     </IressProvider>,
   );
   ```

For alternative ways to import the theme, see the [Themes documentation](/docs/themes-introduction--docs).
