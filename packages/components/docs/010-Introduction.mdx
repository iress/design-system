# Iress Design System

<IressBadge mode="info">{version}</IressBadge>

---

The Iress Design System (IDS) serves as a shared visual language, working code, design tools and resources, human interface guidelines, and a community of contributors. It supports designers and developers building digital products for both B2B (Financial Advisors, Paraplanners) and B2B2C (client customers) segments.

## What's new?

      <p>
        IDS has released our first pattern, `IressLoading`, allowing you to
        display loading feedback to users consistently across different
        applications no matter the scenario.
      </p>
      <p>It is available as of `5.10.0`.</p>

        </IressButton>
      }
    >
      <p>
        You can now use `IressTheme` from the `@iress/ids-themes` package to
        quickly add a theme to your application. No more messing around with CDN
        urls, now you just need the name of the theme and you are good to go.
