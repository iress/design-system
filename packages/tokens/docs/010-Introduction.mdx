# Tokens

<IressText textStyle="typography.body.lg">
  Design tokens are an integral part of the design system. They help us create
  consistency across components by sharing common design decisions and simplify
  our theming ecosystem.
</IressText>

## What are tokens?

Tokens are a set of variables that define the design properties of a component. They are used to define the visual properties of a component, such as colours, typography, spacing, and more.

## Token list

The table below shows all the new and old tokens in the design system. Use the filters to narrow down the list of tokens.

## For developers

If you are using the IDS components, the tokens have already been mapped out to their respective components. You can use the tokens in the component props to change the visual properties of the component.

</IressButton>

```jsx
import { IressText } from '@iress-oss/ids-components';

<IressText color="colour.primary.text">I am branded text</IressText>;
```

If you are not using the IDS components, you can use the tokens directly by using the `cssVars` object from `@iress-oss/ids-tokens`.

```jsx
import { cssVars } from '@iress-oss/ids-tokens';

<div style={{ color: cssVars.colour.primary.text }}>I am branded text</div>;
```
